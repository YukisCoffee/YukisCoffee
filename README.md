# Hi!

### I'm **Taniko Yamamoto**. &nbsp; ![She/They](https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%99%80-she%2Fthey-blueviolet)

I do mainly web development related things on this account, but I might do other things too.

Mainly, I crave to satisfy my autistic obsession with the internals of YouTube, so that's primarily what you'll see me do. I am a lead developer of the Rehike project, which implements a custom YouTube server that accurately and perfectly emulates the pre-2017 layout. That said, I'm not very secretive and if have any curiosities about the internals of YouTube yourself, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Check out things I'm involved with!
