# Hi!

### I'm **Taniko Yamamoto**. &nbsp; ![She/They](https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%99%80-she%2Fthey-blueviolet)

I do mainly web development related things on this account, but I might do other things too.

Mainly, I crave to satisfy my autistic obsession with the internals of YouTube, so that's primarily what you'll see me do. I am a lead developer of the Rehike project, which implements a custom YouTube server that accurately emulates the pre-2017 layout perfect.

Check out things I'm involved with!
