# Hi!

### I'm **Taniko Yamamoto**. &nbsp; ![She/They](https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%99%80-she%2Fthey-blueviolet)

I do mainly web development related things on this account, but I might do other things too.

I'm a lead developer of the Rehike project, which seeks to restore the old YouTube layout. Currently, there is no estimated release date nor public testing plans.
